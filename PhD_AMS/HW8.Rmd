```{r Q1, echo=TRUE}
T84 <- read.table("./Fall 2016/Applied Multivariate Statistics/Wichern_data/T8-4.DAT")
cov(T84)
T84_PCA <- prcomp(T84,center=FALSE,scale. = FALSE)
T84_PCA
summary(T84_PCA)
eigenvalues <- T84_PCA$sdev*T84_PCA$sdev
eigenvalues
```
a) The covariance matrix is computed from the cov() function, and the sample principle components are computed from the prcomp function.

b) The proportion explained by the first three principle components are 89.968%. The first factor may capture the performance of the whole economy, while the second factor may capture the performance of each industry.

c) According to the formula in 8-33, The 90% confidence interval for the first three eigenvalues are (0.00106, 0.00195), (0.00054, 0.00100), and (0.00019, 0.00036) respectively.

d) Since 80.286% of the variance is already captured by the first two factors, perhaps including two factors is sufficient.
